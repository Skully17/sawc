Markup is used for small documents that doesn\'t need to look really nice.

You need to add two spaces at the end of a paragraph to create a linebreak  

_you can encase text with "\_"s to make it italic_  
**you can encase text with "\*"s to make it bold**  
``you can encase text with "`"s (not a single speachmark) to make it monospace``  
~~you can encase text with "&#126"s to make it strikethrough~~  

You can use "---" to add a line to the page.

An extra linebreak will need to be added so it's not made into a sub header like this.

You can make:
* bullet point lists
* by putting "* "
* infront of text

You can make:
1. A numbered list
2. by putting "x. "
3. infront of text
4. where x is
5. the number you want

[links can be made by using "\[text to show on page\](link/to/direct/to)"]()
